        <h1 id="title">The Legend of Hancos</h1>
        <div class="container" id = "essay">
          <p>Hanco’s: the unassuming bubble tea place at the heart of Park Slope that has a staggering reputation for being the meeting place of choice for Brooklyn teens. Hanco’s reputation extends so far out that the average Brooklyn high schooler has a story of their own about Hanco’s. Hanco’s is a quaint yet industrious bubble tea and Vietnamese sandwich shop on the corner of 7th Avenue and 10th Street in Park Slope. It has a dark green awning that extends a foot or so out from the top of the shop that looms over the restaurant like a thunderstorm cloud, ready to pour at any moment. Their bubble tea is fine, their Vietnamese sandwiches are ok at best, and their pho tastes good maybe if eaten while having a cold and too congested to taste much. But yet teenagers flock to Hanco’s to sit around the store, eat, and hangout. Hanco’s is a simple Vietnamese sandwich and bubble tea shop that not only has an astounding reputation for being a meeting place for Brooklyn teens, but also has a great impact on its surroundings that goes relatively unnoticed to the average customer.</p>
          <p>The most important thing about Hanco’s is that its popularity is not about the food or ambiance. If someone knows about Hanco’s solely because of its food or ambiance, they are either lying or are an adult. Hanco’s is popular because it is Hanco’s. Not for its food, not for its ambiance, and certainly not for its friendly service. Most of Hancos’ customers do not go for food, but instead to meet friends. Hancos’ popularity began for a reason, however, which allowed it to take off as the metaphorical “center” of Park Slope. The cafe that occupied the storefront where Hanco’s now is was colloquially called the Tea Lounge. It was a meeting place for stay-at-home moms, babysitters with young kids, and young adults to go and have a cup of coffee midday. It had big plush couches that felt like they were swallowing you when you sat down on them. It was quiet, so people could get their work done easily during the day. But, before 2010, the cafe closed down and Hanco’s replaced it. New Yorkers were apprehensive about trying the new restaurant, but they gave in eventually and tried their best to enjoy themselves while still grieving over the loss of their beloved cafe. Most of them found the food decent, as it is, and it became their regular bubble tea place in the neighborhood. It slowly became, “Meet me at Hanco’s” instead of “Meet me at the Tea Lounge,” while also being a mere one minute walk from the Seventh Avenue subway station, the central station of Park Slope. This led to many outsiders from other neighborhoods discovering Hanco’s by accident while wandering around  the neighborhood. Also, Park Slope residents would use Hanco’s as a convenient meeting place by the subway station to meet their friends from other neighborhoods before venturing more into the depths of Park Slope. Because of this, Hanco’s became the de facto hub of Park Slope, and many teens and tweens began showing up there regularly for their bubble tea fix. </p>
          <p>Many years later, after being consumed by the mob of teenagers daily, the Hanco’s bathroom and tables began looking like works of art, signed by anyone and everyone in the city. When going into the Hanco’s bathroom, the average Brooklynite could pick out at least one or two names of people they know, scribbled on the walls with sharpies and razor blades alike. This bathroom represents the history and life of New Yorkers, leaving their mark in a place where others have left their marks too. New Yorkers make things their own, but only after being introduced to them by a friend. As such, word of mouth is the best advertiser a restaurant can ask for, and Hanco’s got incredibly lucky in that regard. But, Hanco’s does have an impact on its surroundings that goes unnoticed to the general public. For example, there is Tenth Street, the forgotten cross street that Hanco’s sits on. Whether it's the copious amounts of industrial grade cleaner Hanco’s dumps on the sidewalk nightly, the minivan perpetually blocking the driveway, the teenagers smoking outside of the garage, or the chef squatting on the side steps on his break, the presence of Hanco’s leaves a mark on Tenth Street. There is a clear dividing line between the resentful Tenth Street residents and the Hanco’s customers who hang around the top of the block. Sometimes, reputation comes at a price. Whether the Tenth Street residents like it or not, Hanco’s will be the hotspot for Park Slope activity until this generation of teens grow up and another famous restaurant takes its place, repeating the cycle over again.</p>
